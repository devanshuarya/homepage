I am a PhD candidate in the Intelligent Sensory Information Systems group at the University of Amsterdam, advised by  <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.worring/">Prof. Marcel Worring</a>. My current research focus is representation learning on graph-structured data, in particular multimodal learning using hypergraphs. 

I have worked on developing graph based deep learning models that are scalable to datasets with many modalities, with applications in recommedner systems, link predictions and neuroimaging. I am also part of the <a href="http://www.asgard-project.eu//">ASGARD</a> project, whose aim is to develop AI powered solutions for forensic investigations that can directly contribute towards the Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) technological autonomy across EU.

I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur in 2015 with a B.Tech-M.Tech dual degree in Electrical Engineering. My formal background is in speech signal processing. I worked on developing Voice Activity Detection (VAD) algorithms during my master's thesis and during my internship at NTU Singapore.
