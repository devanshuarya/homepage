abstract = "This demo presents a system for journalists to explore video footage for broadcasts. Daily news broadcasts contain multiple news items that consist of many video shots and searching for relevant footage is a labor intensive task. Without the need for annotated video shots, our system extracts semantics from footage and automatically matches these semantics to query terms from the journalist. The journalist can then indicate which aspects of the query term need to be emphasized, eg the title or its thematic meaning. The goal of this system is to support the journalists in their search process by encouraging interaction and exploration with the system."
